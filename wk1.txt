Geometry

calculate the volume of a sphere with radius 20mm. Formula for sphere volume is 4/3.Π.r3

Output the result with a nice message. allow the user to enter a radius for the above program and output the result.

import math
​
r= 2
Π=3.14159
​
v = ((4/3)Π(r**3))
​
​
print("The volume of the sphere is " + (str(v)) + " cm3")
​
​
The volume of the sphere is 33.51029333333333 cm3
calculate the volume of a cylinder, allowing the user to input the height and radius, and then print the output with a nice message.

import math
​
​
r=input("length of radius")
h=input("Height of cylinder")
Π=3.14159
v= (Π)(r**2)(h)
​
​
​
print(("The volume of the cylinder is ") + (str(v)) + (" cm3"))

import math
​
r=int(input("length of radius: "))
h=int(input("Height of cylinder: "))
Π=3.14159
​
v=(Π)(r**2)(h)
​
print(("The volume of the cylinder is ") + (str(v)) + (" cm3"))
length of radius: 9
Height of cylinder: 6
The volume of the cylinder is 1526.8127399999998 cm3
calculate the volume of a cone, allowing the user to input the height and radius, and then print the output with a nice message.

import math
​
r=int(input("Length of radius: "))
h=int(input("Height of cylinder: "))
Π=3.14159
​
v=(Π)(r**2)(h/3)
​
​
​
print(("The volume of the cone is ") + (str(v)) + (" cm3"))
​
Length of radius: 2
Height of cylinder: 3
The volume of the cone is 12.56636 cm3

Conversion
calculate the fuel efficiency achieved on a journey, allowing the user to input the distance travelled and the amount of fuel used.

import math
​
#d=distance
#f=fuel consumed
#fe=(d/f)
​
d=int(input("Distance travelled: "))
f=int(input("Fuel consumed: "))
​
fe=(d/f)
#print(str(fe))
print(("The fuel efficiency of the car is ")+ (str(fe))+ ("km per litre"))
​
​
Distance travelled: 250
Fuel consumed: 3
The fuel efficiency of the car is 83.33333333333333km per litre
Currency Exchange

create a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter, with user input create a Celsius to Fahrenheit converter, with user input combine the calculators into one, and allow the user to choose which conversion to do (hint: you'll need to use an if statement).

#c=celsius
#f=farenheit
​
#calc=(f-32)5/9=c
​
f=int(input("Degrees farenheit: "))
​
c=(f-32)(5/9)
​
print(("The temperature converted to degrees celsius is: ")+ (str(c)) + (" C"))
Degrees farenheit: 100
The temperature converted to degrees celsius is: 37.77777777777778 C

#c=celsius
#f=farenheit
​
#calc=(f-32)5/9=c
​
c=int(input("Degrees celsius: "))
​
f=(32)+((5/9)(c))
​
print(("The temperature converted to degrees farenheit is: ")+ (str(f)) + (" F"))
Degrees celsius: 0
The temperature converted to degrees farenheit is: 32.0 F

write three key features of Python that make it one of the most popular languages for programming?

It is free and open source. 2) It is a simple language. 3)It is easy to learn.
What problems has Python faced as a language and ecosystem?
It is slow in comparison to other languages, its not a good language for mobile development/smartphone applications and has design restrictions.

What major software/applications are built on Python (name 3 not mentioned already)?

Youtube 2)Instagram 3)spotify
What relationship does it have with GIS (not mentioned already)?
Use of Python is increasing rapidly in GIS. It is used with ArcGIS and QGIS and has allowed users to create specific programs to access a wide array of tools and utilities.
